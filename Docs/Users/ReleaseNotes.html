<h2>WinMerge 2011.002.027 Release Notes</h2>
This is a maintenance/bugfix release of WinMerge 2011.
It is intended as a replacement for any of the predecessor versions listed below:
<ul>
<li>2011.001.527
</ul>

<h2>WinMerge 2011.001.527 Release Notes</h2>
<p>
This is the first stable release of WinMerge 2011.
It fixes a number of bugs and regressions that have been found in the last beta,
and finally includes a compiled help file created from a revised version of the
WinMerge&#160;2 DocBook sources. If you have worked with WinMerge&#160;2, and
want to learn about the most relevant differences, section <i>File transforms</i>
and the <i>Frequently asked questions</i> 3.6 and 7.2 are of particular interest.
<p>
WinMerge&#160;2011 still lacks an equivalent for WinMerge&#160;2's prediffer plugins.
My vague plan with this is to provide line filters with knowledge of both side's content.
This would kind of demand a bit more expressive power than regular expressions can offer,
but JavaScript/VBScript are good options.
