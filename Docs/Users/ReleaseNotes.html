<h2>WinMerge 2011.003.523 Release Notes</h2>
This is a stable release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011.
<br>Significant new features since the preceding stable release include:
<ul>
<li><p>Line filters exist in a new flavor referred to as <i>early-applied</i> line filters:
	<br><a name='WinMerge.chm' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011_help/downloads/WinMerge.chm'>WinMerge.chm</a> &rarr; <i>Using Filters</i> &rarr; <i>Using line filters</i> &rarr; <i>Early-applied line filter syntax</i>
<li><p>The <i>Open</i> dialog's <i>Include Subfolders</i> option can be adjusted to ignore folder structure:
	<br><a name='WinMerge.chm' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011_help/downloads/WinMerge.chm'>WinMerge.chm</a> &rarr; <i>Quick start</i> &rarr; <i>Selecting files and folders to compare</i> &rarr; <i>5.</i>
<li><p>Editor scriptlets are back:
	<br><a name='WinMerge.chm' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011_help/downloads/WinMerge.chm'>WinMerge.chm</a> &rarr; <i>Plugin scriptlets</i>
<li><p>Folder compare supports customizable background colors to make differences more visible.
	<br>This feature can be configured through <i>Edit</i> &rarr; <i>Options</i> &rarr; <i>Colors</i> &rarr; <i>List</i>.
<li><p>When comparing folders on machines with &gt; 2 CPU cores, WinMerge creates multiple compare threads to get the job done faster.
	<br>The number of compare threads is usually one less than the number of available CPU cores.
	<br>A different value can be configured through <i>Edit</i> &rarr; <i>Options</i> &rarr; <i>Compare</i> &rarr; <i>Folder</i> &rarr; <i>Number of compare threads</i>.
<li><p>The location bar remains responsive during drag-drop editing. This greatly eases drag-drop moving of text over long distances.
	<br>While in drag-drop mode, you can stop scrolling by holding down the <i>Shift</i> key.
<li><p>File compare allows for setting synchronization points to help in situations where WinMerge fails to reasonably match portions of involved files.
	<br>After clicking into the lines you want synchronized,
	<i>Merge</i> &rarr; <i>Synchronization Point</i> will place a synchronization point at these lines.
	<br>Repeat above steps to remove an existing synchronization point.
	<br>Invoke <i>Merge</i> &rarr; <i>Clear Synchronization Points</i> to remove all synchronization points at once.
	<br>This feature is adopted from <a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/sdottaka/winmerge-v2'>Takashi's fork</a>.
<li><p>Unicode processing has been revised to <i>support</i> surrogate pairs rather than being actively destructive on them.
	A beneficial side effect of this enhancement is the option to choose between
	having combining characters visually combine with their preceding ones, or
	keeping them separate like WinMerge used to do due to its unawareness of the very concept.
	<br>The option to <i>Separate combining characters</i> is accessible through <i>Edit</i> &rarr; <i>Options</i> &rarr; <i>Editor</i>.
<li><p><i>Edit</i> &rarr; <i>Options</i> &rarr; <i>Colors</i> now offers an option to <i>Cross-hatch deleted lines</i>.
<li><p>Folder comparison results can be saved to an Excel spreadsheet.
	<br>Besides the <i>Save to Excel spreadsheet</i> command, the Folder Compare window's <i>Tools</i>
	menu includes commands for viewing and printing with Excel Viewer. These assume that you use
	<a target='_blank' href='http://priede.bf.lu.lv/ftp/pub/RakstuDarbi/apskatei/Microsoft/xlviewer2003.exe'>Excel Viewer 2003</a>.
	Newer versions don't seem to allow for direct printing through command line, and also lack options to adjust column widths and apply auto filters.
	Be sure to also apply the updates located at
	<a target='_blank' href='http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=16872'>Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (SP3)</a> and
	<a target='_blank' href='http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4134'>Security Update for Microsoft Office Excel Viewer 2003 (KB973484)</a>.
<li><p>File/directory filters have been enhanced to allow for combining both inclusion and exclusion rules.
	<br>Omitting the <i>def:</i> label in an <i>.flt</i> file makes <i>f:</i> and <i>d:</i>
	operate as inclusion rules unless prefixed with <i>x</i>, in which case they operate as exclusion rules.
	<br>The <i>f:</i> and <i>d:</i> labels, again optionally prefixed with <i>x</i> to form an exclusion rule, can also be used with wildcard filters.
<li><p>With <a target='_blank' href='http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24659'>LogParser 2.2</a> installed,
	you can enjoy more elaborate folder compare filter options by using SQL in your file/directory filters.
	<br>All <i>.flt</i> files installed with WinMerge contain a default
	SQL filter which you can enable at your option when filling in the <i>Open</i> dialog.
	The default SQL filter allows you to specify minimum and maximum modification times and sizes.
	All fields are checked with IS NULL so as to have only the filled in fields take effect.
	SQL filters are enabled and filled in separately for each side.
	The default SQL filter can also be combined with simple wildcard filtering, in which case WinMerge loads it from the <i>FileFilter.tmpl</i> file.
<li><p>Processing of archive formats which are unknown to 7-Zip can be delegated to external command line tools.
	<br>An example is PowerBuilder library (<i>.pbl</i>) files.
	A command line tool to handle them can be found <a target='_blank' href='http://sqlbatch.com/pd/'>here</a>.
	<br>Read <a target='_blank' href='http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=879'>here</a>
	on how to set up an <i>ExternalArchiveFormat.ini</i> to enable on-the-fly extraction of <i>.pbl</i> file contents.
<li><p><i>Wrapper scripts</i> can help automate tasks which would otherwise require user interaction.
	<br>A first application of this new feature is <i>GenerateHTMLReport.WinMerge</i>, which you find in the WinMerge program folder.
	<br>Invoking it without arguments provides usage information.
<li><p>The setup now offers a <i>Portable media</i> option to install WinMerge in such way that it will not modify the registry of the system on which it is running.
	<br>
	<u>Known issue:</u> On Windows XP and other pre-Vista systems, this option can only be used from an administrator account.
<li><p><i>File</i> &rarr; <i>Start Collection</i> opens a folder compare window in <i>collect mode</i>.
	WinMerge will prompt you for an existing <i>reference folder</i>
	to represent the right-hand side of the folder compare session,
	and create a temporary folder for the left-hand side.
	<br>The reference folder will typically contain your working copy of
	some source code which is maintained in a source control system.
	Subsequent command line invocations will then add items to the existing
	folder compare window, rather than opening them to new file compare windows,
	provided they meet the condition of one of the specified files being located
	inside the reference folder, and the other one being located outside of it.
	The file that is located outside of the reference folder will be copied to
	the temporary left-hand side folder, assigning it the same name as the file
	located inside the reference folder, and creating subfolders as needed to
	match the structure of the reference folder.
	<br>The feature aims at supporting offline code reviews, for which you would
	eventually store the collected items in an
	<i>original&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;altered</i> archive (a.k.a. <i>Perry-style</i> patch),
	using the context menu's <i>Zip</i>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<i>Differences</i> command.
<li><p>ClearCase .mrgman files can be opened to a folder compare window, by dropping them onto the WinMerge main window.
	<br>The header bars provide context menus to switch between base, source, and destination versions of the referenced files.
</ul>
