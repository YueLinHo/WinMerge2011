<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.003.037 Release Notes</h2>
This <b>experimental</b> release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011 allows for saving folder comparison results to an Excel spreadsheet.
<p>
The related commands can be invoked from the Folder Compare window's <i>Tools</i> menu:
<ul>
	<li>Save to Excel spreadsheet
	<li>Show in Excel Viewer
	<li>Print with Excel Viewer
</ul>
Note that the above commands apply to only the selected lines, so you may need to <i>Select All</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu or hit <i>Ctrl+A</i> first.
<p>
If you face issues with some recent version of Excel Viewer, then Excel Viewer 2003 may be your friend.
<p>
Minor usability improvements:
<ul>
	<li>The folder compare progress dialog now shows the paths of the files being compared.
		It was argued by some that, being lazily updated, this information is wrong most of the time.
		It was argued by others that they still want this information because it gives them a clue about files which require an unexpectedly large amount of processing time.
		I agree with the others.
	<li>Rearranging columns in Folder Compare window now preserves the current selection.
	<li>When navigating from a subfolder back to its parent, the selection within the parent folder will be set to the previously listed subfolder.
</ul>

<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.002.212 Release Notes</h2>
This <b>experimental</b> release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011 makes the
<i>Compare As</i> option accessible through the command line.
The feature aims at supporting use cases like the one outlined
<a target='_blank' href='http://bernhardelbl.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/compare-excel-word-and-pdf-files-in-visual-studio-team-foundation-server-2010'>here</a>.
In the given example, an extra parameter
<code><nobr>-t</nobr>&nbsp;"script:\FileTransforms\xdoc2txt.wsc"</code>
is needed to tell WinMerge&nbsp;2011 to pipe files through
<a target='_blank' href='http://www31.ocn.ne.jp/~h_ishida/xdoc2txt.html'>xdoc2txt</a>.
The reason is that WinMerge&nbsp;2011 does not provide file transform
automatisms like WinMerge&nbsp;2 does
(which is an explicit design decision driven by the realization that file
transform automatisms have caused much confusion for WinMerge&nbsp;2 users).
<p>
Furthermore, fixes are included to address issues
<a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issue/18'>#18 Binary compare reports false positives</a> and
<a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issue/19'>#19 diff pane size not remembered</a>.

<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.002.145 Release Notes</h2>
This <b>experimental</b>
release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011 implements two substantial new features:
<ul>
<li>Line filters can now act as prediffers, i.e., operate on content before
	WinMerge passes it down to the diff algorithm.
	An example is given
	<a target='_blank' href='http://shortlinks.de/l999'>here</a>.
	More examples are to follow.
	<p>
	Prediffers can be specified in either of the following forms:
	<ul>
	<li>Capturing regular expressions
		<p>
		All parts of a match which are covered by a submatch are removed,
		or replaced by a fixed sequence of characters, whose length is,
		for technical reasons,
		limited to the length of the shortest possible submatch.
	<li>Prediffer scriptlets
		<p>
		A prediffer scriptlet implements a method with name
		<code>ProcessLine</code>,
		which is called once per line to perform preprocessing as desired,
		subject to the limitation that the length of the processed line must not
		exceed the length of the original line.
		<p>
		By maintaining state, prediffer scriptlets are also capable of taking
		into consideration preceding content. For this purpose, they need to
		expose a method with name <code>Reset</code> to reset their state.
		WinMerge indicates the side on which a prediffer scriptlet is
		subsequently going to operate by passing the <code>Reset</code> method
		a value of 0&nbsp;or&nbsp;1. This allows a prediffer scriptlet to keep
		knowledge gathered from the left side for reference during processing of
		the right side.
	</ul>
<li>The Open dialog's <i>Include Subfolders</i> option has been extended to
	support situations where folder structure differs between sides, but files
	on both sides are uniquely identifiable by their names, and hence can be
	matched without considering folder structure.
	When encountering name collisions, WinMerge attempts to resolve them by also
	considering sizes and modification dates of the involved files.
	<p>
	To enable this special mode of operation, repeat clicking the
	<i>Include Subfolders</i> checkbox until it yields a visual appearance that
	is different from <i>checked</i> and <i>unchecked</i>,
	and an annotation shows up indicating that folder structure will be ignored.
</ul>
<p>
