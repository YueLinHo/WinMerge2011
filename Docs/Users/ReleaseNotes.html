<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.002.145 Release Notes</h2>
This <b>experimental</b>
release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011 implements two substantial new features:
<ul>
<li>Line filters can now act as prediffers, i.e., operate on content before
	WinMerge passes it down to the diff algorithm.
	An example is given
	<a target='_blank' href='http://shortlinks.de/l999'>here</a>.
	More examples are to follow.
	<p>
	Prediffers can be specified in either of the following forms:
	<ul>
	<li>Capturing regular expressions
		<p>
		All parts of a match which are covered by a submatch are removed,
		or replaced by a fixed sequence of characters, whose length is,
		for technical reasons,
		limited to the length of the shortest possible submatch.
	<li>Prediffer scriptlets
		<p>
		A prediffer scriptlet implements a method with name
		<code>ProcessLine</code>,
		which is called once per line to perform preprocessing as desired,
		subject to the limitation that the length of the processed line must not
		exceed the length of the original line.
		<p>
		By maintaining state, prediffer scriptlets are also capable of taking
		into consideration preceding content. For this purpose, they need to
		expose a method with name <code>Reset</code> to reset their state.
		WinMerge indicates the side on which a prediffer scriptlet is
		subsequently going to operate by passing the <code>Reset</code> method
		a value of 0&nbsp;or&nbsp;1. This allows a prediffer scriptlet to keep
		knowledge gathered from the left side for reference during processing of
		the right side.
	</ul>
<li>The Open dialog's <i>Include Subfolders</i> option has been extended to
	support situations where folder structure differs between sides, but files
	on both sides are uniquely identifiable by their names, and hence can be
	matched without considering folder structure.
	When encountering name collisions, WinMerge attempts to resolve them by also
	considering sizes and modification dates of the involved files.
	<p>
	To enable this special mode of operation, repeat clicking the
	<i>Include Subfolders</i> checkbox until it yields a visual appearance that
	is different from <i>checked</i> and <i>unchecked</i>,
	and an annotation shows up indicating that folder structure will be ignored.
</ul>
<p>
