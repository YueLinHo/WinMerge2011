<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.005.187 Release Notes</h2>
This is a beta release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011.
<br>Besides fixing bugs, it includes the following functional enhancements:
<ul>
<li><p>File transform scriptlets can provide custom logic for writing back
	edited files. They do so by implementing method <code>CreateTextFile</code>,
	which returns an interface that implements method <code>Write</code>.
	<br>As an example of such scriptlet, <i>gedcom.wsc</i> transforms GEDCOM
	files in a way that enables WinMerge to produce more meaningful results, by
	adding complete nesting context to every line of involved files.
	<br>When saving back edited files, <i>gedcom.wsc</i> removes the added
	context, thereby restoring syntactic integrity.
	<br>Another interesting aspect of <i>gedcom.wsc</i> is how it reads ANSEL or
	UTF-8 input, and writes UTF-8 output, using the Scripting.FileSystemObject,
	despite of its TextStream interface not exactly being designed to support
	anything but ANSI or UTF-16 encoding.
<li><p>Find &amp; Replace with regular expressions allows replacement strings to
	contain submatch references \0 through \9 (where \0 refers to the complete
	match), as well as C-style control character escapes.
<li><p>Option <i>/config</i> points WinMerge to a JSON configuration file which
	it will use instead of the system registry to maintain most of its settings.
	<br>Settings for the WinMerge shell extension are an exception in that they
	are always kept in the system registry.
	<br><i>/config</i> replaces the defective <i>/reghive</i> option, which
	turned out to be inherently unfixable.
	<br>If a <i>WinMergeU.json</i> exists in the folder from where
	<i>WinMergeU.exe</i> is started, then WinMerge will use it by default.
	This is a preferable way to install WinMerge on portable media.
	<br>There is no <i>WinMergeU.json</i> included in the distro because it can
	be trivially created as an empty text file.
<li><p>When creating a .WinMerge project file, you can instruct WinMerge to
	maintain most settings in a project specific JSON configuration file so you
	can tweak them to specific needs without affecting the global settings. 
	The configuration file is created in the same folder as the project file.
	The name of the configuration file is formed by appending extension
	<i>.json</i> to the name of the project file.
</ul>
