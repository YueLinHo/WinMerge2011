<h2>WinMerge 2011.004.525 Release Notes</h2>
This is a stable release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011.
<br>Besides fixing bugs, it includes the following functional enhancements:
<ul>
<li><p>The option to automatically check out read-only files from Visual SourceSafe or Rational ClearCase now also exists for Team Foundation Server.
	<br>When the checkout fails, you have a new option to continue as if no version control system was selected, i.e. try to overwrite the file or save it elsewhere.
<li><p>File filters have been enhanced as requested <a href='http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1074'>here</a>.
<li><p>When choosing <i>Tell from filename extension</i> as the <i>Compare As</i> method, WinMerge selects the effective <i>Compare As</i> method based on the filename extension.
	<br>Filename extensions are mapped to file transform monikers as per section <i>FileTransforms</i> of <i>Supplement.ini</i>, which you can edit to meet your particular requirements.
<li><p>The option to include the windows shell context menu in the folder compare view's context menu now also exists for the textual file comparison view.
	<br>This enhancement was contributed by <a href='https://bitbucket.org/magelu'>magelu</a> and is tracked <a href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issue/51/shell-context-menue-for-mergeeditview'>here</a>.
	<br>Known issue: The binary file comparison view disregards this option. This may or may not change in future.
<li><p>Folder compare report types now also include <i>Semicolon-separated list</i> to help cope with applications which prefer it that way.
</ul>
